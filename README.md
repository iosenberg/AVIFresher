# AVIFresher

AVI Fresher is an unofficial reskin of AVI Fresh's menu website for the Stevenson Dining Hall at Oberlin College. We use a Python-based web scraper to scrape the data from AVI's original website, and display it in a more legible format, with the ability to sort by nutritional qualities and filter by dietary restrictions.
